  Institute of Good Doggy is a Catholic fun page run by a group of friends who share a love for the Holy Mother Church and the Holy Mass in the Roman Rite. On the website, in addition to memes poking fun and provoking at various aspects of the Catholic world, we hope to share our thoughts on the state of today's world. 
  
  *PLEASE NOTE that we are not an official representative of the Catholic Church.
  It's just a dogepage :P

  "Institutum Bono Canis est pagina ludens catholica a gruppo amicorum administrata, quos amor Sanctae Matris Ecclesiae et Missae Sanctae in ritu Romano coniungit. In pagina, praeter ludibria quae in omnes partes mundi catholici feruntur, cogitata nostra de statu huius saeculi adhuc apparere speramus. NOTAMUS nos non esse representatorem officialem Ecclesiae Catholicae."
